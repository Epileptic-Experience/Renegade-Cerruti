# Renegade Comics E-commerce
this project is part of my react development course with the intention of implementing the knowledge passed upon me in class plus my previous knowledge in html,css and vanilla js
it attempts to mimic an online shop for comics with a lot more functions and optimization updates planned for later on development

# needed dependecies

to run this app you'll have to install Node.js so you can install the requiered dependecies, you can do that at [https://nodejs.org/en/]
after you get that done you can go ahead and type `npx create-react-app your-file-name` on your CMD or prefered command console, where your-fire-name is the name you want to give to the folder (don't forget to position yourself at the desired location for the folder using `cd` to move through your files) 
after that you can type `npm run start` in your console to initialize react's basic layout, shortly after a window should open on the url `http://localhost:3000`,  other hosts in the network might browse to `http://192.168.0.137:3000` for local access
to edit the files and start doinmg some actually working app just open the created folder to acces it's code

# react-router-dom

react-router-dom is used in this project, to install it locally open your console (be it the one on your code editor,CMD or any other external console you use) and type `npm install react-router-dom `

# react-bootstrap & bootstrap-icons
react-bootstrap (not to be confused with regular bootstrap) is also used here alongside with bootstrap-icons, to locally install them follow the process listed in react-router-dom instalation but type `npm install react-bootstrap` & `npm install bootstrap-icons `

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
